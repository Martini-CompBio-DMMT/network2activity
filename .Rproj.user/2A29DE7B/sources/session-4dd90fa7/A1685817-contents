Description: The package comprises some functions which, from a regulatory 
    network and a gene expression matrix obtained by RNA-Seq data and a list of 
    regulator genes, creates an .adj file needed by the package VIPER to create 
    the regulon object. Moreover, the package allows to infer the protein
    activity using pre-computed signatures specific for different contexts, or
    computing a signature starting from the original dataset and employing
    them with the VIPER algorithm.
